# jdo ✨

**Just Do One thing at a time**

An AI-powered terminal app for people who want to achieve their goals without drowning in project management overhead. Have a conversation, and jdo turns your intentions into a structured plan you can actually follow through on.

## 🤔 Why jdo?

Most productivity tools ask you to learn their system. jdo asks you one question: *What do you want to accomplish?*

Tell it in plain language. The AI extracts goals, milestones, tasks, and commitments—organizing everything into a hierarchy that makes sense. No forms to fill out. No clicking through menus. Just talk about what matters to you.

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Hierarchy

jdo organizes your work into five levels. Use as many or as few as you need:

```
Vision ─────────────── "Become financially independent"
   │
   └── Goal ────────── "Build passive income stream" (due: Dec 2025)
          │
          └── Milestone ─── "Launch info product"
                 │
                 └── Task ────── "Write course outline"
                        │
                        └── Commitment ─── "Send draft to editor by Friday"
```

### Example Conversation

```
You: I want to get promoted to senior engineer this year

 AI: I've created a goal for you:

     Goal: "Get promoted to senior engineer"
     Due: December 31, 2025

     What would make this happen? Any specific milestones
     you're thinking about?

You: I need to lead a major project and improve my system design skills

 AI: Added two milestones:

     • Lead a major project
     • Improve system design skills

     Want to break either of these down into specific tasks?
```
