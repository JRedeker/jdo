  philosophy: |
    JDO is built on Meta Performance™ Institute (MPI) principles:
    - Commitments are promises, not preferences - make fewer, keep them all
    - Integrity = deliver, notify, clean up - it's the engine of workability
    - Vision leads - goals and commitments must trace back to a vivid future picture

  honor_your_word_protocol:
    title: "Honor-Your-Word Protocol"
    priority: critical
    complexity: high
    status: proposed
    category: integrity
    
    description: |
      Implements MPI's three integrity rules:
      1. Do what you said by when you said
      2. Notify the right people as soon as you know you won't
      3. Clean up the mess caused
      
      This transforms "abandoned" commitments into a structured recovery workflow
      that maintains integrity even when commitments can't be met.
    
    current_behavior: |
      Commitments have only `abandoned` status with no structured recovery.
      No stakeholder notification system. No cleanup tracking.

notes:
  review_cadence: |
    This document should be reviewed when:
    - Starting a new development cycle
    - User feedback suggests feature gaps
    - New MPI guidance becomes available
  
  promotion_criteria: |
    Items are promoted to active development when:
    - Priority is critical or high AND resources available
    - User demand is demonstrated
    - Prerequisite features are complete
  
  philosophy_alignment: |
    All features should align with MPI principles:
    - Does this help users keep commitments?
    - Does this support integrity (deliver, notify, cleanup)?
    - Does this connect actions to vision?
